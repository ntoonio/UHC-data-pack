# Minecraft UHC Data pack
This is a datapack for starting a UHC game with only two commands.

**For now it's in Swedish. This will be changed soon. As well as adding more customizability**

## `/function uhc:setup`
This will create a spawn platform where the players can select their teams (including spectator), as well as read some rules/information

## `/function uhc:start`
This will spread out the players in a 5000x5000 area, and the game can begin.
